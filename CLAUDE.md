## Features

### 1. Google Sign-In
- Firebase Authentication with Google provider (popup flow)
- Unauthenticated state → sign-in screen only
- Authenticated state → full app with 4 tabs: Practice, Check Worksheet, My Performance, Settings

### 2. Practice Tab
- User sets a duration (minutes) and selects one or more question types, then clicks Start
- Selection persists in localStorage across sessions
- Random questions from the selected types appear one at a time; answer submitted with Enter
- Four question types (toggled with chip buttons, at least one must be active):
  - **Addition** — two 2-digit numbers (10–99), e.g. `47 + 83 = ?`
  - **Subtraction** — two 2-digit numbers (larger − smaller, no negative results)
  - **Multiplication** — randomly alternates between 3-digit × single digit (100–899 × 2–9, not a multiple of 100) and simple times-table style (2–10 × 2–13)
  - **Percentages** — convert a fraction to % rounded to 2 decimal places
- Live score counters (Correct / Wrong) with bump animation on each answer
- Timer turns red and pulses at ≤ 30 seconds remaining
- Pause / Resume supported (timer + answer checking both freeze)
- On session end: summary shown + session auto-saved to Firebase RTDB

### 3. Check Worksheet Tab
- Student uploads a photo (JPG/PNG) or scan (PDF) of a completed handwritten worksheet
- PDF: rendered to canvas via pdf.js (page 1 only), then sent as JPEG base64
- Image: read as base64 via FileReader
- Sent to the **user's selected AI model** (see Settings) with a structured prompt
- AI returns JSON: `[{question, studentAnswer, correctAnswer, isCorrect}]`
- Results displayed as a table with ✓ / ✗ per question and a correct/wrong summary
- Shows which model was used at the bottom of the results
- **"Automatically try other models" checkbox** (checked by default): when unchecked, only the selected model is attempted with no failover

**Worksheet prompt design (`upload.js → WORKSHEET_PROMPT`):**
The prompt is a 7-step structured instruction. The model's only job is to read handwriting — it never computes answers. `correctAnswer` and `isCorrect` are always returned as `""` and `false`; the app fills them in client-side.

- **Step 1 — Orientation:** mentally straighten a tilted or rotated photo before reading anything
- **Step 2 — Count every `=` sign:** scan the full image and count all printed `=` signs before reading any answers. Each `=` is exactly one problem. The output array must contain exactly this many items. This forces the model to acknowledge the full image including rightmost columns before it starts.
- **Step 3 — Identify columns:** treat each column as a vertical newspaper strip; identify all column boundaries before reading
- **Step 4 — Read one complete column at a time:** finish the entire column top-to-bottom before moving right. Never scan horizontally across the page.
- **Step 5 — Use the `=` sign as a horizontal anchor:** for each line, find the printed `=` sign, read left at the exact same horizontal level for the question, and right for the student's answer. Both operands must be on the same horizontal level as the `=`. This was added to stop Gemini borrowing the second operand from the line above (e.g. reading `3 + 2` instead of `3 + 4` when `2` appeared on the preceding line).
- **Step 6 — Transcribe the student's answer:** faint pencil marks count; empty blank → `"blank"`; unreadable marks → `"unreadable"`
- **Step 7 — Self-verify:** count output array items; if fewer than the Step 2 count, find the missing problems and add them before returning

**Client-side math verification (`upload.js → verifyMath`):**
Before rendering, `verifyMath(results)` runs over every row. It calls `computeAnswer(questionStr)` which parses the question string and computes the correct answer in JavaScript (handles `+`, `−`, `×`, and fraction-as-percentage). The computed value overwrites `r.correctAnswer` and `r.isCorrect` is re-evaluated with 0.01 tolerance. This means AI math errors can never affect the final verdict — models only need to read handwriting, all arithmetic is done client-side.

**Client-side blank/unreadable enforcement (`upload.js → displayWorksheetResults`):**
After `verifyMath`, the app additionally forces `isCorrect = false` for any row where `studentAnswer` is `"blank"` or `"unreadable"`. Safety net in case a model ignores the prompt instruction.

**JSON response parsing (`upload.js → parseAIJSON`):**
Models (especially Groq/OpenRouter) frequently return malformed or decorated JSON. Five recovery passes are tried in order before giving up:
1. Direct `JSON.parse` (happy path)
2. Strip trailing commas before `]` or `}` — most common Groq mistake
3. Truncate to the last fully-closed `}` — handles responses cut off mid-generation
4. Convert single-quoted strings to double quotes — some models use JS object syntax
5. Extract every `{…}` block individually and assemble them into an array — last resort
- The extraction regex is `\[\s*\{…\}\s*\]` (requires array of objects), not just `\[…\]`, so preamble text like `[note: 4 columns detected]` doesn't poison the match
- All markdown fences (` ```json `) are stripped before parsing
- `console.error` logs the raw model output when all passes fail, for debugging

**Retry + auto-failover logic (upload.js):**
- **Rate limit (429):** switch to next model immediately — no retries. Retrying a rate-limited model is pointless (quota resets after 60s).
- **Transient overload (503, "high demand"):** retry up to 3 times with exponential back-off (5s → 15s → 30s) before switching.
- After exhausting retries, switch to the next model (in accuracy ranking order) that has a saved key.
- Repeat until all available models are exhausted, then show an error.
- Live loading message updates at each step so the user knows what's happening.
- **Auto-retry checkbox** controls whether failover happens at all; when unchecked the loop runs for only the selected model.
- **Primary failover path:** AI Studio Gemini 2.5 Flash → OpenRouter Gemini 2.5 Flash (same model, separate quota) → Groq/Qwen as last resort.

### 4. My Performance Tab
- Line chart (Chart.js): X = session date, Y = questions per minute
- Tooltip on each point shows: correct count, wrong count, duration
- Session history table sorted newest first
- Delete any session (confirmation modal)
- Manually add a session (date, duration, correct, wrong) — useful for paper sessions

### 5. Settings Tab — Multi-Model AI Selector
- 4 model cards displayed in a 2-column grid (1 column on mobile)
- Each card shows: provider icon, model name, provider name, tag badge, star accuracy rating, RPM, and key status indicator (✓ / ○)
- Clicking a card selects it and shows a panel below with:
  - API key guide (numbered steps with direct link to the key page)
  - API key input (pre-filled if already saved)
  - Save button
- Selected model is stored in `localStorage.selectedModel`
- Per-model keys saved to both localStorage and Firebase RTDB

**Available models (ranked by accuracy):**

| # | Model | Provider | Stars | Free RPM | localStorage key | Firebase key |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Google AI Studio | ★★★★★ | 5 RPM | `geminiApiKey` | `geminiKey` |
| 2 | Gemini 2.5 Flash (free) | OpenRouter | ★★★★★ | Varies | `openrouterApiKey` | `openrouterKey` |
| 3 | Llama 4 Scout | Groq | ★★★ | 30 RPM | `groqApiKey` | `groqKey` |
| 4 | Qwen 2.5 VL 72B (free) | OpenRouter | ★★★ | Varies | `openrouterApiKey` | `openrouterKey` |

Notes:
- Models 1 and 2 are the same Gemini 2.5 Flash model via different providers — separate quota pools. When AI Studio hits 5 RPM, auto-failover switches to OpenRouter's copy instantly.
- OpenRouter models 2 and 4 share the same API key; saving either updates the same Firebase field
- Llama 4 Scout accuracy is ★★★ after real-world testing showed inconsistent handwriting recognition, wrong correctAnswer values, and intermittent column-skipping
- Auto-failover skips any model with no saved key
- The upload tab shows a small badge with the currently selected model name

### 6. API Key Onboarding Modal
- On first login (or any login where no model has a key), a modal appears after 0.7s
- Modal suggests Google AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Flash) as the quickest option, mentions Groq/OpenRouter as alternatives
- "Skip for now" dismisses the modal for that session
- Once any key is saved, the modal never reappears

## Data Structure (Firebase Realtime Database)

```
sessions/
  {uid}/
    records/
      {pushId}/
        date        — ISO 8601 string
        durationMin — integer (minutes set by user)
        correct     — integer
        incorrect   — integer
        totalQ      — correct + incorrect
        qPerMin     — totalQ / durationMin (float, 2dp)

users/
  {uid}/
    geminiKey       — string (Google AI Studio key)
    groqKey         — string (Groq API key)
    openrouterKey   — string (OpenRouter API key, used for both OR models)

error_logs/
  {uid}/
    {pushId}/
      ts        — ISO 8601 string (when the failure occurred)
      model     — string (model name that returned the bad response)
      error     — string (which failure point triggered: "No JSON array found" or "All 5 parse passes failed")
      response  — string (raw model text, capped at 3000 chars — no image data stored)
```

`error_logs` is written automatically whenever `parseAIJSON` cannot recover the model's response. Review in Firebase Console → Realtime Database → `error_logs/{uid}/`. Image base64 is never stored here.

## Firebase Realtime Database Rules

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "sessions": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    },
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    },
    "error_logs": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Apply in: Firebase Console → Realtime Database → Rules → Publish.

---

## Deployment

- **Live URL:** https://teja1995.github.io (served from `main` branch)
- **Phase 2:** Custom domain (after limited-user testing). When switching:
  - Add new domain to Firebase → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains
  - No code changes needed

---

## One-Time Setup (Firebase project)

1. **console.firebase.google.com** → Add project (disable Analytics)
2. **Authentication** → Get started → Enable Google provider
3. **Authentication** → Settings → Authorized domains → add `teja1995.github.io`
4. **Realtime Database** → Create Database → Start in test mode → apply rules above
5. **Project Settings** → Your Apps → Web (`</>`) → Register → copy config into `firebase-config.js`
   - Use only the plain `const firebaseConfig = { ... }` object — remove any `import` statements Google adds
   - The file must end with `firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);` and `const db = firebase.database();`

## API Keys (per user, not developer)

### Google AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- Get from: **aistudio.google.com/app/apikey** (NOT Google Cloud Console — Cloud Console keys have 0 free quota)
- Free tier: 5 RPM, 250K TPM
- `gemini-2.0-flash` and `gemini-1.5-flash` showed 0/0 RPM on free-tier keys → `gemini-2.5-flash` is the only confirmed free model (v1beta endpoint)

### Groq (Llama 4 Scout)
- Get from: **console.groq.com/keys** (free account, no credit card)
- Free tier: 30 RPM, 14,400 req/day
- Uses OpenAI-compatible endpoint with `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`

### OpenRouter (Gemini 2.5 Flash free, Qwen 2.5 VL)
- Get from: **openrouter.ai/settings/keys** (free account)
- Free `:free` model variants — may have rate limits and queue delays
- One key covers both OpenRouter models (`google/gemini-2.5-flash:free` and `qwen/qwen2.5-vl-72b-instruct:free`)
- OpenRouter requests include `HTTP-Referer: https://teja1995.github.io` per their usage policy
- Primary purpose: acts as overflow for AI Studio when it hits 5 RPM — same Gemini 2.5 Flash model, separate quota

## Key Decisions & History

| Decision | Reason |
|---|---|
| Realtime Database instead of Firestore | Firestore requires billing/card details; RTDB free tier does not |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` (v1beta) as default/recommended | 2.0 Flash and 1.5 Flash show 0/0 RPM on free tier AI Studio keys; 2.5 Flash has confirmed 5 RPM |
| Multi-model support (Groq, OpenRouter) | Gemini 2.5 Flash has only 5 RPM — during high demand the model is unavailable; alternatives provide failover |
| 429 triggers immediate failover, 503 retries with backoff | Rate-limit errors mean quota is exhausted — retrying the same model for 50s is pointless. 503/overload is transient, so backoff + retry makes sense. Splitting the two error types eliminated long waits on Gemini's 5 RPM limit. |
| OpenRouter slot changed from Gemini 2.0 Flash to Gemini 2.5 Flash | Gemini 2.5 Flash on OpenRouter (`google/gemini-2.5-flash:free`) is the same model as AI Studio but uses a separate quota pool. When AI Studio hits 5 RPM the failover is lossless — same accuracy, no quality degradation. |
| OpenAI-compatible format for Groq/OpenRouter | Both use the same `/v1/chat/completions` format with `image_url` content type — one code path serves both |
| Model keys stored in Firebase (not only localStorage) | Mobile browsers clear localStorage; Firebase persists keys across devices and browser resets |
| No format validation on API keys | Prefix checks like `AIza` were rejecting valid keys; wrong keys now fail gracefully at the API with a clear message |
| CDN compat SDK (not ES modules) | No build step needed; works directly on GitHub Pages |
| Column-aware prompt | Generic prompt caused model to read numbers from adjacent rows as answers; explicit spatial layout rules fixed accuracy |
| GOLDEN RULE in prompt + client-side enforcement | Models (both Gemini and Groq) were filling in computed answers for blank spaces and marking them correct; opening the prompt with "you are a checker not a giver" + client-side `isCorrect=false` override fixed it |
| 5-pass JSON recovery | Groq and OpenRouter return trailing commas, single quotes, preamble text, or cut-off arrays; a single `JSON.parse` fails too often; five progressive recovery passes handle all observed failure modes |
| Extraction regex requires array of objects | Plain `\[[\s\S]*\]` matched `[note: 4 columns]` preambles and poisoned the parse; `\[\s*\{…\}\s*\]` requires the array to contain objects so only the real answer array matches |
| Two-step scan prompt for multi-column reading | Llama 4 Scout read only the first column and stopped; restructuring the prompt as "Step 1: scan full image and count columns" then "Step 2: read each column" with an explicit minimum-result warning fixed it |
| AI Studio key required for Gemini (not Cloud Console) | Cloud Console keys have 0 free-tier quota for Gemini regardless of model |
| models.js loaded before auth.js | auth.js iterates MODELS to restore keys; models.js must exist as a global first |
| Operation selection saved to localStorage | Students often practice the same type each day; persisting the chip selection avoids re-selecting every visit |
| Client-side math verification (`computeAnswer` + `verifyMath` in upload.js) | AI models — especially Llama 4 Scout — miscalculate correct answers and flag answers wrong even when the student is right; computing the correct answer in JS eliminates this entirely. Models now only need to read handwriting; we do the math. |
| Llama 4 Scout accuracy downgraded to ★★★ | Real-world testing showed inconsistent handwriting recognition, wrong correctAnswer values, and intermittent column-skipping — not consistent with ★★★★ performance |
| Model prompt returns `correctAnswer: ""` and `isCorrect: false` always | Asking the model to compute correct answers introduced errors (especially Llama); now the model only reads handwriting and the app computes everything. Simplifying the model's job also makes JSON output more reliable. |
| `=` sign used as horizontal anchor in prompt | Gemini was reading the first operand from the current line but picking the second operand from the line above (e.g. "3 + 2" instead of "3 + 4"). Instructing the model to read both operands at the same horizontal level as the printed `=` sign fixed cross-line borrowing. |
| Count `=` signs before reading (Step 2) + self-verify after (Step 7) | Model was skipping columns and returning inconsistent counts on repeated runs. Counting all `=` signs first forces the model to acknowledge the full image; the self-verify step catches early exits before the response is returned. |
| Temperature = 0 on all API calls | Temperature 0.1 caused different results on identical images. Setting to 0 makes output fully deterministic — the same image always produces the same response from the same model. |
| Auto-retry checkbox (checked by default) | Users wanted to control whether the app silently switches models. Checkbox unchecked = selected model only, no failover; checkbox checked = current behaviour. |
